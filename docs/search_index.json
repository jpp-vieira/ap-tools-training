To learn more about the Analytical Platform and to get up and running, go to the Analytical Platform chapter. More extensive information is provided by the Analytical Platform user guidance. 1.3 R mentoring It is recommended that all who are new to R or Data and Analysis request an R mentor. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a better on-the-job R learning experience and raise awareness of the preferred Data and Analysis ways of working that will for instance enable people to get up to speed more quickly with others’ code. The scheme is also open to non-coders who need to use the Analytical Platform to advise them through the learning process, and for those commencing a more complex project involving the use of R. To request an R mentor please complete this mentee form. If you could become an R mentor (we have a shortage of mentors) please complete this mentor form. For more information please contact Jose Vieira. 1.4 Internal Training Group materials This internal training is recommended for those working in Data and Analysis as it enables you to get up and running with R, SQL, Python and Git/GitHub using the MoJ Analytical Platform. The main introductory R, SQL and Git/GitHub sessions are usually run live in February/March, June/July and October/November each year while you can also work through R, SQL, Git/GitHub and Python sessions yourself using the training material and/or recordings. To learn more about the sessions currently available and how to access the material and recordings, go to the Internal Training Group materials chapter. 1.5 Coffee and Coding The internal training (see above) is complemented by Coffee and Coding presentations. These presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using particular coding methods. For more information go to the Coffee and Coding chapter. 1.6 Bite-sized sessions There are also short sessions (generally talks of up to 15mins followed by Q/A) on a variety of topics including specialist as well as softer skills. Recent topics have included: Key components of RAP in MoJ coding projects Learning and Development in 2023-24 ChatGPT for coding - Know your Frenemy Conducting an RCT in the CJS; trying, failing &amp; what could succeed next time Hints and tips on public speaking You can find recordings of bite-sized sessions: from 2023 onwards in the new video library. from before 2023 in the old video library. For more information including if you are interested in presenting a session or joining the bite-sized session facilitation team please contact Aidan Mews. 1.7 Analytical Function training There are many Analytical Function training opportunities for analysts including about specialist topics not presently covered internally.

For more technical details, you can also read the user guidance section About the Analytical Platform. 2.2 Summary of key terms It will help you to be familiar with the following key terms: Analytical Platform (AP): A data analysis environment providing modern tools and key datasets for MoJ analysts. AP contains training documents, resources, and access to various analytical software such as Rstudio and Jupyter. Control Panel: A place to navigate to Rstudio, Jupyter, S3 Buckets etc RStudio: Development environment for writing R code and R Shiny apps JupyterLab: Development environment for writing Python code including Python notebooks Git: Version control software that enables multiple people to make separate changes at the same time. GitHub: A web-based interface that uses Git and on which you publish and share your version-controlled code. You use Git locally (e.g. using RStudio) to track versions of your code, and then submit those changes to Github. GitHub Repositories (Repo): Similar to setting up a project folder on DOM1 shared drive to save work and share with others. Files on Github Repos represent the definitive version of the project. Everyone who works on the project makes contributions from their own personal versions. Amazon S3: A web-based cloud storage platform. Where your home directory stores working copies of code, data and final analytical outputs should be stored in Amazon S3. Access to amazon S3 buckets can be managed. Slack: Collaboration tool where you can get technical support for Analytical Platform tools such as R, Python, Git. You can share knowledge, submit admin requests and communicate quickly with other AP users. 2.3 Getting set up First, so that you can request any help you need when getting set up on the Analytical Platform, it is recommended that you join the Data and Analysis Slack. You can find out more about it here. Second, follow the steps in the Getting Started section of the Analytical Platform User Guide. You need to: Set up a GitHub account with two-factor authentication. Set up a Analytical Platform account. Once you have completed the above two steps, you should be able to access the Analytical Platform Control Panel and from there open the relevant tool (e.g. RStudio for R). Third, as code written on the Analytical Platform should be stored in a Git repository on GitHub, complete the steps to configure Git and GitHub for the Analytical Platform. You can learn more about GitHub by viewing or attending the internal Introduction to Git/GitHub. For those that need to get set up to use Athena databases for SQL (in R or Athena) on the Analytical Platform, please follow the additional instructions in the “Training Requirements” section of the Introduction to SQL training repository. 2.4 Managing data Once you have got set up on the Analytical Platform, do read about the following data management/handling topics: How data are held on the Analytical Platform and finding the data you need. You can read about the three different data storage options (Amazon S3, Curated databases and home directories). Working with Amazon S3, data FAQ, the Data Uploader tool and interacting with Amazon S3 via the Analytical Platform. Information governance procedures to be followed. Data retention policies including when deleting data means they are permanently deleted.

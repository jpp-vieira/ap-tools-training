# Internal Training Group materials {#ITG}

This internal training is recommended for those working in Data and Analysis as it is run using the MoJ Analytical Platform. There are live R, SQL and GitHub training sessions, which are generally run in February/March, June/July and October/November each year. You can also work through the R and SQL sessions yourself using the training material and recordings. There is also Python training in development; we are considering how best to run these.  

## R Training

The following sessions are available; click on the links to view the material in the GitHub repositories. The first two are particularly recommended for new starters.   

* [Introduction to R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/IntroRTraining)
* [R Charting](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/ggplotTraining)
* [Introduction to R +](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_r_training_extension)

The recordings of these R training sessions are available on the [R training MS Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/aa3cda5d-99d6-4e9d-ac5e-6548dd55f52a).

## GitHub Training

Whether seeking to use R, SQL or Python, it is recommended that all newcomers attend this [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/git-training-class) (click on link to view material in GitHub repository) session.	

## SQL Training

All newcomers who are to use SQL should attend the [Introduction to SQL](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/sql_training) (click on link to view material in GitHub repository) session. A recording of this session is available on the [SQL training MS Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/7cd1cdaf-79cb-4e1e-ab2b-448d8f69f6a1).

## Get involved!

One great way of learning is by teaching. If you would be interested in being part of the R, SQl and/or Python training groups, whether booking courses/allocating places, designing training, or presenting, please contact Aidan Mews, Georgina Eaton or George Kelly.

If you have any questions please contact Aidan Mews, Georgina Eaton or George Kelly.

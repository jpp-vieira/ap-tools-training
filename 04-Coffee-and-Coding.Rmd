## About Coffee and Coding

The aim of the MoJ Coffee and Coding presentations is to nurture, enable and encourage a vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at MoJ. Coffee & Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within MoJ who are interested in coding to:

* Share skills and knowledge
* Showcase their work and projects
* Provide advice and guidance to each other
* Network and get to know each other

Code can be shared from any language — whether R, Python, SQL, or other more specialised languages.

The format is generally 30–40 minutes for a presentation, followed by time for questions. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods.

## Recorded presentations

Where possible, Coffee and Coding presentations are recorded to allow people to catch up on talks they may have missed and to provide a useful training resource for colleagues.

These recordings are available on the [Coffee and Coding Microsoft Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/f6aa6c5d-e90c-44b7-8ccc-28a318fa0630). We regularly update the access list, but if you cannot access the videos please contact the Coffee and Coding mailbox.

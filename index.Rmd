# Summary of available resources {#summary}

## The Analytical Platform
The Analytical Platform is a data analysis environment, enabling the use of modern open source tools such as R and Python, and holding key datasets for MoJ analysts. Watch [this 2-3 min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5467Hl3X9EI&t=95s) to gain a brief summary about it.

To learn more about the Analytical Platform and to get up and running, go to the [Analytical Platform](#AP) chapter. More extensive information is provided by the [Platform user guidance](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/#content).

## R mentoring
It is recommended that all who are new to R or DASD request an R mentor. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a better on-the-job R learning experience and raise awareness of the preferred DASD ways of working that will for instance enable people to get up to speed more quickly with others’ code. The scheme is also open to non-coders who need to use the Analytical Platform to advise them through the learning process, and for those commencing a more complex project involving the use of R. To request an R mentor please complete [this mentee form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KEeHxuZx_kGp4S6MNndq2PdkMZw8L-FEkMSL2t4Oet1UQVlWMUwzOVZRNUVKSTVZU0pPTUY0MDlZTSQlQCN0PWcu). If you could become an R mentor (we have a shortage of mentors) please complete [this mentor form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KEeHxuZx_kGp4S6MNndq2PdkMZw8L-FEkMSL2t4Oet1UNUw1N1M0NVNQSTNOVkdHOUtMQ1lMT0lHTSQlQCN0PWcu). For more information please contact Jessica Dawson.

## Internal R (and SQL) Training Group materials
The live R, SQL and GitHub training sessions are generally run twice or three times each year. However, recordings are available so you can work through yourself. These sessions are run using the MoJ Analytical Platform so they are recommended for those working in DASD (or with the Analytical Platform). You can view the material (in the Github repositories) at:

* [Introduction to R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/IntroRTraining)
* [R Charting](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/ggplotTraining)
*	[Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/git-training-class)
*	[R Markdown](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rmarkdown_training)
*	[Interfacing Excel with R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/r-excel-training)
*	[Writing Functions in R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/writing_functions_in_r)
*	[Developing R packages & RAP ways of working](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rpackage_training)
*	[Introduction to SQL](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/sql_training)

The recordings of the R and SQL training sessions (the Introduction to GitHub session has not yet been recorded) are stored on MS Stream in the links below:

* [R training MS Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/aa3cda5d-99d6-4e9d-ac5e-6548dd55f52a)
*	[SQL training MS Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/7cd1cdaf-79cb-4e1e-ab2b-448d8f69f6a1)

One great way of learning is by teaching. If you would be interested in being part of the R (and SQL) training group, whether booking courses/allocating places, designing training, or presenting, please contact Aidan Mews or Georgina Eaton. 

If you have any questions please contact Aidan Mews or Georgina Eaton.

## Coffee and Coding and Bitesize sessions
The internal R/SQL/Github training (see above) is complemented by [coffee and coding](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/f6aa6c5d-e90c-44b7-8ccc-28a318fa0630) and [bitesize](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/5a6012a2-efd6-4b86-902d-98c864427caa) sessions. The contacts are Katharine Breeze and George Papadopoulos respectively.

## Analytical Function training opportunities
There are now many technical Analytical Function training opportunities for analysts including about topics not presently covered internally e.g. an introduction to python. Examples useful for RAP practitioners include [Best practice in programming – clean code – GSS (civilservice.gov.uk)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training/best-practice-in-programming-clean-code/) and an [Introduction to unit testing – GSS (civilservice.gov.uk)](Introduction to unit testing – GSS (civilservice.gov.uk)). You can view such opportunities via:

*	[A user-friendly list (but not updated since Jan 2021)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/af-learning-curriculum-technical)
*	[GSS Training Courses (many which are open to all analysts)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training-courses/)

## Datacamp
Paid Datacamp licenses are beneficial to cover gaps in current training provision that are not picked up by either internal or GSS/Analytical function training currently e.g. more advanced R, SQL, and python skills. You can read more about Datacamp [here](https://www.datacamp.com/). If you would like to have a Datacamp license please get approval from your deputy director and contact Aidan Mews.

## Other assistance
Technical help can be requested via the following [DASD slack channels](https://asdslack.slack.com/): 

* intro_R which provides support to those starting out in the world of R and RAP.
*	R which is for beginners and experts alike.
*	sql
*	python

# Analytical Platform {#AP}

## Quick start
Please follow the steps in the [Getting Started section of the Analytical Platform User Guide](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/get-started.html#get-started). To use the Analytical Platform you then need to access the [Analytical Platform Control Panel](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/tools/) and from there open the relevant tool (e.g. RStudio for R). 

As code written on the Analytical Platform should be stored in a Git repository on GitHub, complete the steps [to configure Git and GitHub for the Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github.html#setup-github-keys-to-access-it-from-r-studio-and-jupyter).

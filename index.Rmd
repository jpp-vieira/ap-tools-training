# Summary of available resources {#summary}

## The Analytical Platform
The Analytical Platform is a data analysis environment, enabling the use of modern open source tools such as R and Python, and holding key datasets for MoJ analysts. 

To learn more about the Analytical Platform and to get up and running, go to the [Analytical Platform](#AP) chapter. More extensive information is provided by the [Analytical Platform user guidance](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/#content).

## R mentoring
It is recommended that all who are new to R or Data and Analysis request an R mentor. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a better on-the-job R learning experience and raise awareness of the preferred Data and Analysis ways of working that will for instance enable people to get up to speed more quickly with others’ code. The scheme is also open to non-coders who need to use the Analytical Platform to advise them through the learning process, and for those commencing a more complex project involving the use of R. 

To request an R mentor please complete [this mentee form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KEeHxuZx_kGp4S6MNndq2PdkMZw8L-FEkMSL2t4Oet1UQVlWMUwzOVZRNUVKSTVZU0pPTUY0MDlZTSQlQCN0PWcu). If you could become an R mentor (we have a shortage of mentors) please complete [this mentor form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=KEeHxuZx_kGp4S6MNndq2PdkMZw8L-FEkMSL2t4Oet1UNUw1N1M0NVNQSTNOVkdHOUtMQ1lMT0lHTSQlQCN0PWcu). For more information please contact Jessica Dawson.

## Internal Training Group materials

This internal training is recommended for those working in Data and Analysis as it enables you to get up and running with R, SQL, Python and GitHub using the MoJ Analytical Platform. The main introductory R, SQL and GitHub sessions are run live in February/March, June/July and October/November each year while you can also work through R, SQL and Python sessions yourself using the training material and/or recordings. To learn more about the sessions currently available and how to access the material and recordings, go to the [Internal Training Group materials](#ITG) chapter.

## Coffee and Coding and Bitesize sessions
The internal training (see above) is complemented by [coffee and coding](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/f6aa6c5d-e90c-44b7-8ccc-28a318fa0630) and [bitesize](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/5a6012a2-efd6-4b86-902d-98c864427caa) sessions. The contacts are Katharine Breeze and George Papadopoulos respectively.

## Analytical Function training opportunities
There are now many technical Analytical Function training opportunities for analysts including about topics not presently covered internally e.g. an introduction to python. Examples useful for RAP practitioners include [Best practice in programming – clean code – GSS (civilservice.gov.uk)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training/best-practice-in-programming-clean-code/) and an [Introduction to unit testing – GSS (civilservice.gov.uk)](Introduction to unit testing – GSS (civilservice.gov.uk)). You can view such opportunities via:

*	[A user-friendly list (but not updated since Jan 2021)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/af-learning-curriculum-technical)
*	[GSS Training Courses (many which are open to all analysts)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training-courses/)

## Datacamp
Paid Datacamp licenses are beneficial to cover gaps in current training provision that are not picked up by either internal or GSS/Analytical function training currently e.g. more advanced R, SQL, and Python skills. You can read more about Datacamp [here](https://www.datacamp.com/). 

If you would like to have a Datacamp license please contact Aidan Mews or Rosina Costello providing a brief explanation about why it will be important for your work along with approval from your deputy director.

## Other assistance
Technical help can be requested via the following [Data and Analysis slack channels](https://asdslack.slack.com/): 

* intro_R which provides support to those starting out in the world of R and RAP.
*	R which is for beginners and experts alike.
*	sql
*	python
